# TrevDGL203CSS-Project

## Introduction
For this project, I intend to make a (kind of real kind of fake) website for The Fork and Arrow in Campbell River. I say kind of real kind of fake because I want to use some images and logos from their instagram, so it'd look real. But fake in that I likely won't be presenting this to them or anything, so I won't need to go to them to make sure any text I'm writing is 100% accurate or not.

## Methods
I could easily see grid and flex being very useful here, especially for the menu page. So I'm sure I'll end up using at *least* grid.
