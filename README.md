# TrevDGL203CSS-Project

## Introduction
For this project, I intend to make a (kind of real kind of fake) website for The Fork and Arrow in Campbell River. I say kind of real kind of fake because I want to use some images and logos from their instagram, so it'd look real. But fake in that I likely won't be presenting this to them or anything, so I won't need to go to them to make sure any text I'm writing is 100% accurate or not.

## Methods
I could easily see grid and flex being very useful here, especially for the menu page. So I'm sure I'll end up using at *least* grid. Animation wise, I could see myself using keyframe animations to style the buttons in the navbar. Aside from the buttons, I'm not sure I see a use for them on this website so far, *maybe* for floating in images or something? But I find that more distracting and not really of the "clean and simple" look I'm going for here. The instructions say we'll probably want to use Bootstrap and Sass? I've heard those names before but I'm not sure what they mean yet, but if the instructions say they're good, I'd imagine I'll use them.

## So Far
The milestone 1 it says we need to submit:
- A project proposal (which is what this is, at least I'm assuming, since I don't see any outline anywhere). 
- Interface mockups, which can be found in the [Wireframes](Wireframes) folder. 
- A description of methods we intend to use, which you read in [Methods](#methods)

Later on, it says we need to do a "one-page project summary IN HTML/CSS" which I've never really heard before? To me, that meant just doing a sort of skeleton of the index and CSS page, which I did in [index.html](index.html) and in [styles.css](styles.css)
